# Fixing Unexpected Screen Rotation & Incorrect Orientation with OptiSigns Android Stick

Some Smart TVs have auto-rotation enabled by default, which can also affect devices connected via HDMI, including OptiSigns Android Stick players.

A few Smart TVs known to have auto-rotation enabled by default include:

  * Samsung Frame TV
  * Samsung Smart TV 
    * Neo QLED 4K (QN85B, QN90B, QN95B, QN900B, QN800B, QN700B)




If you experience unexpected screen rotation or incorrect orientation when using OptiSigns on your TV screen, the issue may be due to the TV’s rotation settings.

**There are Two Ways to Fix This:**

  1.      1. **Disable Auto-Rotation in the TV’s Settings**  

        * Open the TV’s Settings Menu
        * Go to Display or Screen Settings
        * Find “Auto-Rotate” or “Screen Rotation”
        * Disable this option  
  

     2. **Adjust HDMI Input Settings for OptiSigns Players**
        * From the TV’s Home Screen, navigate to the HDMI input where the OptiSigns Player is connected
        * Press and hold the Select button
        * Choose “Edit”
        * Change the device name/type to “PC”


  *     * 


This will ensure that the device follows the orientation settings configured in the OptiSigns web portal. If you have feedback on how to make the how-to guides better, please let us know at: [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com)
