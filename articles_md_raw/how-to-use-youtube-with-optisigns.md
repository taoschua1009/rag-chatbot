# How to use YouTube with OptiSigns

Putting YouTube video on your digital signs screens is easy with OptiSigns.

## **Let's jump in and get started:**

First, you will need to have your screens set up and paired. For more information on how to do that, click [here](https://www.optisigns.com/blog/how-to-set-up-digital-signs-with-optisigns-and-amazon-fire-tv).

Then log on to our portal: <http://app.optisigns.com/>

Go to Files/Assets, Click on "App".



Click YouTube (or YouTube Live):



Enter your YouTube video information:



  * **_Name_** : Give your YouTube video a name. This is for displaying in your asset list only. The app will try to get the video's title and use as name, but you can change it to something else.
  * **_URL_** : Paste the link to your YouTube video here. This should be the actual URL, not the Share link:





  * _**Caption** :_ If the YouTube video has closed caption, the app will show it. Note: closed caption must be created by the YouTube video author, auto generated caption may not work. 



Click Save.  
After Saving, you can Preview the video to verify.  
  


## **That's all! Congratulations!**

You have added a YouTube video.

You can assign the newly created YouTube asset to your screen by going to Screens, click Edit screens and assign the wall to screens that you want.

You can put the YouTube Video to a Playlist, Schedule too.
