A clothing store uses a rotating playlist on their screens to showcase seasonal collections, promotions, and styling tips. This dynamic display engages customers, keeps content fresh, and drives sales by highlighting new arrivals and special offers.  
  
## Let's Get Started:

You can add various types of content to your playlists, including images, videos, web links, and apps. These items can be mixed and matched in any order and duration.

**1.** First, you will need to **create an asset** from your [Files/Assets page](https://app.optisigns.com/app/assetManagement) to add content to your playlist.

**2.** Alternatively, you can click the '**Playlists** ' tab, then on the right side, click '**New**.' From there, you can either create an asset or upload files, templates, or feeds.

**Example:**



## **How to Create a Playlist**

**1.** To create a playlist, navigate to "**Playlist** " on the top navigation bar.  
**2.** Click "**Create Playlist** ".



**3.** Click on the **pencil** icon to change the playlist name.



**4.** Name it something that is easily identifiable to you. In this case, let's name it "**Lobby TV Playlist.** "



**5.** **Drag and drop** the videos/images that you want uploaded into the playlist.



Note: You can view an example of what the playlist would look like below in the next step.

**7.** Lastly, when your Playlist is ready, you can push your content to screens by selecting the '**Push to Screens** ' icon on the top of your playlist.



You can either:  
---  
Push your content to a screen(s) immediately  
Schedule it for a future time  
Or, temporarily take over the screen for a specific period. I.e., 5 minutes, and then revert back to previous content
