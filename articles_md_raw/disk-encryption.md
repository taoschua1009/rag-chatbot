## How to Set Up Encryption on an OptiSigns Player

To get started, attach a keyboard to your OptiSigns Player. When booting up, rapidly press the **Up Arrow** to gain access to the Restore mode menu. It should look like this:



Here, hit Factory Reset. You’ll be asked whether or not to enable encrypted disks. Type **Yes** and hit Enter.



It will ask you to create a password. Create one, then complete the Factory Reset.

**! VERY IMPORTANT !**

The password you set up will be required to be input every time you wish to recover data from your drive. Make sure to save this password in a safe place that you’ll have access to, or else you will not be able to retrieve data from the device.  
  
If you bring up Restore mode again, you should see the **Encrypted Boot** option there. This means you have successfully encrypted the OptiSigns Player drive. From now on, it will be booted with the encryption in place.
