# How to Clear Cache on a BrightSign Player

### If you're experiencing issues with OptiSigns' applications not performing correctly on your BrightSign player, one of the most common reason is localStorage folder on your SD Card is full.

  * BrightSigns does not provide API for apps like OptiSigns to clear or delete the local cache folder.
  * So after sometime, the folder can be so big that it consume all storage on the SD card and cause issues.

**This can help resolve problems such as apps not updating properly, displaying outdated content, or other performance issues.**

## Follow these steps to clear the cache on your BrightSign player:

### **Step 1: Remove the SD Card**

**1\. Locate the SD Card Slot:** Find the SD card slot on your BrightSign player.



**2\. Eject the SD Card:** Carefully remove the SD card from the slot.



### **Step 2: Clear the Cache from the SD Card**

**1\. Insert the SD Card into a Computer:** Use an SD card reader to connect the SD card to your computer.



**2\. Access the SD Card's Contents:** Once the SD card is recognized by your computer, open it in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).

**3\. Locate the Local Storage Folder:** Search for a folder typically named ‘**localStorage** ’.

  * The exact name can vary based on how the app developer set up the directory structure.





**4\. Check the size of the localStorage Folder**

  * See if the folder is taking up many GBs.



**5\. Delete the localStorage Folder:** Right-click on the folder and select "**Delete** " to clear all cached data.

### **Step 3: Safely Eject and Reinsert the SD Card**

**1\. Safely Eject the SD Card:** Use the “**Safely Remove Hardware** ” feature on your computer to eject the SD card properly, ensuring that no data is being written to the card when you remove it.





**2\. Reinsert the SD Card into the BrightSign Player:** Place the SD card back into the player’s SD card slot.

### **Step 4: Reset/Reboot the Player**

**1\. Reset/Reboot the Player:** Reset or reboot your BrightSign player. It will now reload its contents from the SD card, which no longer includes the previously stored cache.

**Data Safety:** Be cautious when deleting files from the SD card. Make sure you are deleting the correct folder to avoid removing important application files or settings.
