# How to Change Close & Nav Bar Styler Preferences

When you change your Close & Nav Bar Styler Preference settings, it will adjust the default options set for your Kiosk Lite and Kiosk Designer Pro.

While you can modify the settings individually for specific apps, setting a default will help maintain consistency, ensuring your preferences remain unchanged unless manually adjusted.

You can adjust these settings by:

  * First, click on your profile name in the top right corner of your OptiSigns webpage.
  * Then, click on the "Preferences" tab in the drop-down menu.





  * You will then be directed to the Preferences page. To access the Close & Nav Bar settings, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
