## Step 1: Unpair the Screen from Current Account

Unpairing the screen will be slightly different if you have device access, or if you want to unpair the screen via the Web Portal.

Click **here** if you want to use the web portal, which can let you unpair and repair remotely. For use with the device, read on.

### Using OptiSigns Player (With Device Access)

If you have access to the device, simply open the **Hamburger menu** on the OptiSigns Player and hit **Unpair**.



This will Unpair the device and cause the Pairing Code to display:



Now, move on to **step two**.

### Using OptiSigns Web Portal (Remote Access)

If you do not have access to your screen or device, or wish to move screens and accounts remotely, you'll need to perform a few additional steps.

First, go to the OptiSigns Web Portal. Log in to the account with the screen you wish to move. Find it on the **Screens** tab, then hit **Edit Screen → Advanced → More**.



Click the **Info (i)** button



There, you can find the Pairing Code inside the data:



Write this pairing code down or copy/paste it and do not lose it, or else you will not be able to perform the next step.

Next, remove the device from the current account by backing out of this menu, clicking the **Three Dots** , then hitting **Remove** :



This will remove the device from your current account.

Now, log in to your other account. Navigate to the **Screens** tab, then hit **Add Screen**.



Type in the Pairing Code you obtained in Step 1, then hit **Pair** :



Your screen will now be linked to this account.
