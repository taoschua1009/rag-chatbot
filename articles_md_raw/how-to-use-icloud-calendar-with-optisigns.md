## This article will show you how to display an iCloud Calendar on your display screens with OptiSigns.

**Ensure Full iCloud Features**

Before we start, please take a quick moment to ensure your iCloud account is fully equipped.

Sign in to [https://www.icloud.com/](https://www.icloud.com/) and check your account information for the status of all features. This ensures smooth and optimal functionality for your iCloud experience.

 

**Let's jump in and get started:**

#### **1\. Get Your App-Specific Password from Apple**

Before linking your iCloud calendar in Calendly, ensure you have your app-specific password from Apple. This unique password is distinct from your regular Apple login credentials.

Apple mandates the use of an app-specific password, in addition to two-factor authentication, for connecting with third-party apps like Calendly.

To obtain your app-specific password:

  1. Sign in to [https://appleid.apple.com/](https://appleid.apple.com/).
  2. Navigate to Security and activate [Two-factor authentication](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102660) if you haven't already.
  3. Under App-Specific Passwords, click**Generate Password**.  
  
  

  4. Enter a password label (e.g., "iCloud Calendar") and select Create.  

  5. Confirm your iCloud account password before proceeding to the next step.  

  6. Your app-specific password will then be generated.  

  7. Copy the app-specific password and paste it into your iCloud account settings.
