## What is an Attract Screen?

An **Attract Screen** is what your interactive kiosk will display until someone engages with the screen. Once the screen is interacted with, it will take the viewer to your kiosk. An attract screen could be anything you may want to display to attract passerby's to interact with your kiosk: a visual welcome screen, a rotating playlist of ads, a video of your product or brand, and more!

Here's a simple example we've created, showing you both the attract screen and interactive kiosk!

#### Now, let's get started!

## Creating an Attract Screen

First, you'll want to navigate to the [**Engage Management**](https://app.optisigns.com/app/engageManagement) page.

Select either **New App** or **Touch Screen** Kiosks → **Touch Screen Kiosks** → Click **Select App**

Select **Kiosk Designer** **Pro** → Click **Build**

You'll then be taken to our Designer Pro!

In Designer Pro, select **Widgets** → **Video** → **Select your video** from your asset library

Click on your video element → Click **Format Options** from the top menu bar

A **Format Options menu** will appear on the right side of the screen → Open **Position** → Click**"Use as Background"**

Your video will now become the background on Canvas and you can layer interactive elements over it!

### Linking An Element

For this example, we created a "Tap Here to Begin" button using shapes and texts available in Designer.

Once the element is created, select the element you'd like to be interactive→ Click **Link** → Click "**Add Link"** from the menu on the right.

You can link this element to a **Website URL** or to **an asset** within your asset library.

If you have more than 4 interactive/linked elements on a single page, you may run into performance issues.

Once you've selected your desired link, you adjust your **"Link** **Options"** in the right menu

  * **Scale:** Adjust how the linked element will fit to your screen when pushed
  * **Duration:** This is the maximum duration the asset will display on the screen before returning to the original source it is linked from. 
    * **Preload:** This will preload the asset before being clicked. Select this for a smoother kiosk experience.
  * **Close** **& Nav Bar Styler:** Customize the navigation bar and close icon to better fit your design. 
    * **Icon Position:** Adjust where you'd like the icons to be on your screen.
    * **Icon Style:** Adjust the visual style of the home icon.
    * **Icon** **Color:** Adjust the color of the icon and nav bar elements.
    * **Background Color:** Adjust the background color that exists behind the icons.
    * **Opacity:** This adjusts the visibility of the background color, _not_ the icons.
    * **Icon Size:** Adjust how big or small you'd like the icon and nav bar to appear on your screen.
    * **Show Navigation Bar:** This will add a "Back" and "Forward" button next to the home icon. 

It is highly recommended to turn on the navigation bar for better performance on your device, especially if your kiosk has multiple pages.

Name your design → Click **Save** → **Push to Screens**
