In 2024, [Amazon released an update to FireOS](https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-blocks-long-running-fire-tv-capability-breaking-popular-apps-with-no-warning-and-giving-developers-the-runaround/) disallowing apps to be autostarted on device boot up. Amazon has also released a [Digital Signage Stick](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Signage-Stick-quad-core-streaming/dp/B0D4FCG9MX?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Q2R-IsQqpFLBQnyOzroJsCqvInA20YBPOGzYxBJPkImYB91-GaLrO5UB3QrtLmJNwXLsi1fcGV1xu_Zl1s8COTf9QMkHac5UyzG7eQagHUewWSm6EEX6Ef0TmSwamrXclpPnL6J1v88a_qtAqCQKpVuNT5XuDAY3Qpa6PdiPg7wjiwccWWmcqndZNHXRGySXbmZWq_btwj6lEz6wMm8nGy9OZwFNRh1bLYrx9luXUOk.BITMseiknoYwYECYPBkXIneqN89ySUCEo8SujSNiprA&dib_tag=se&keywords=Digital+Signage+Player&qid=1751559195&sr=8-4&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.74097168-0c10-4b8a-b96b-8388a1a12daf) to replace the FireStick as a digital signage option.  
[Amazon is also pushing advertising services,](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984444/amazon-fire-tv-autoplay-ads-on-startup) so device playback may be randomly interrupted. For these reasons, we no longer recommend FireStick as a digital signage play. We recommend an Amazon Signage Stick, Windows or Linux device, Chromecast, or our [Android Player Stick](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-android-stick-player-2).

**Performance, Freezing:**

  * FireStick and FireTVs are best with 3-4 zones without background music (or 2 zones with background music). If you more zones than that, you may experience instability.



**Check power cables & connections:**

  * One of the most common causes of device stability is not using provided power adapters & cables. TVâ€™s USB ports do not have sufficient power to stably run the device for extended periods of time



**HDMI & TV connection:**

  * Try a different HDMI port on your TV
  * Try to connect device directly to TV without HDMI extender
  * Try a different TV, Monitor



**Device is on, but start playing black screen:**

  * Check to make sure Device is not in [OnHold folder](https://app.optisigns.com/app/screenManagement?path=~2FOnhold%20Device&teamId=1) \- sometimes you may not have enough licenses on your account when ordering devices so your device is in the OnHold folder. 
    * Remove unused device or increase your subscription and move your device out of OnHold
