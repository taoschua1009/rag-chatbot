## Set Up the Virtual Screen App (ALTERNATE METHOD)

Set up a [Virtual Screen app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055900513-How-to-create-and-use-Virtual-Screen-App) as an alternative to the OptiSigns Web Player. This app will provide an alternate URL to use as a Source in our Microsoft Teams Rooms Portal to set up digital signage.

To get started, click **Files/Assets** within the OptiSigns app and navigate to **Apps**.



Search for **Virtual Screen App** , then select it.



You'll see a screen similar to this:



You'll need to fill in the information on the side. 



For this, there are a couple things to note.

First, the **Screen** you select will be what displays on your Microsoft Teams Rooms display. This screen should be configured with the digital signage you want to display there.

Second, the **Share Type** should be set to **URL Link**. It is this URL you will input into the Teams Rooms Professional Portal in the next step.

Now, hit **Save**. Your asset/playlist will show on the right side of the screen, and you'll receive the URL you need. 



This Virtual Room app will now be saved as an Asset on OptiSigns. By clicking on it, you will be able to access the URL anytime. You'll want to enter this into your Custom source within the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal.
