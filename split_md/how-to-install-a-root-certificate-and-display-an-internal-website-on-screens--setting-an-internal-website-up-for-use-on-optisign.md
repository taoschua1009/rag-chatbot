## Setting an Internal Website Up for Use on OptiSigns Using the Website App

The OptiSigns Website app allows you to display an internal website on your screens once a valid private certificate (.pem file) has been installed on your device.

To set it up, navigate to **Files/Assets** in your OptiSigns portal. Find the **Website** app.



Enter the **URL** of your webpage here. The Name field is irrelevant to the app's function and will only make the asset easier to find in OptiSigns.

**NOTE**  
---  
If your internal website is large and complex, you can also display it using the **Advanced Website** app. If you're having trouble displaying it on the basic Website app, create an Advanced Website asset and try again.  
  
Once the Website asset is created, it can be assigned to a screen.
