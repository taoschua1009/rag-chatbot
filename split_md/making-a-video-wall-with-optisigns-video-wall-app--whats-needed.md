## What's Needed?

To set up a video wall for use in the Video Wall app, you'll need:

  * An [OptiSigns subscription](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing) \- Standard Plan or Higher
  * An **[OptiSigns Pro Player](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-digital-signage-player)** or [**ProMax Player**](https://www.optisigns.com/product/hardware/promax-digital-signage-player)
  * A purchase of an OptiSigns Video Wall add-on ($25/monthly/device)
  * Up to four screens (ProMax) or three screens (Pro Player)
  * HDMI/other connectors

**NOTE**  
---  
The Video Wall App can **_only_** be used with the OptiSigns Pro or ProMax Player. It cannot be used in any other capacity.   
**A NOTE ON PRICING**  
---  
The license and Video Wall app apply to the player, not the number of screens. In other words, you will only need one license per video wall, regardless of the number of screens used. Example: say you have a Pro Plus plan license at $15/month. You then want to make a 4-screen video wall using a ProMax Player. You buy a single Video Wall add-on. This lets you run a 4-screen video wall at $40/month. That same $40/month could be used to run a 2 or 3 screen video wall as well.
