### Tag Rules

With Tag Rules, it's possible to set a network of Tags for an Asset to display on.

For example, let's say you want an advertisement to play only in customer-facing screens, but only in certain locations. You can combine these screens into a single Tag Rule, then push content to only those screens.

To do this, select the **Target** to say **Tag Rules** on the Push to Screens tab:



Hit **New:**

****

This will bring up the Screen Tag Rule screen:



Here, you have the ability to **Include** or **Exclude** certain tags using and/or logic commands. You can add **Rules** or **Rulesets** to make these as elaborate as you like:



When you're ready to go, simply click on any Field and you'll be prompted to Add a tag via a dropdown menu:



Now you're ready to include or exclude any tags you'd like. When you're finished, hit **Save**.

You'll then be able to select this Tag Rule on the Push to Screens tab, and use it across your assets.
