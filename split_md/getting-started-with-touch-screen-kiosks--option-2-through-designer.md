### Option 2: Through Designer

**NOTE:** This applies to kiosk designs created through **Kiosk Designer Pro**  
---  
  
To push screens using the Designer app, start by creating your kiosk design. Follow our [Kiosk Designer Pro guide](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/15313086319763-How-to-Design-Kiosk-Apps-Using-Kiosk-Designer-Pro) for step-by-step instructions.

Once you've created your kiosk design, rename it and hit **Save**. Once the asset is saved, the **Push to Screens** option will become available:



Clicking it will open this window:



  * **Asset** \- The name of your asset.
  * **Scale** \- Choose between None, Fit, Stretch, and Zoom. Fit is the default. This shows how the image will be displayed on your screen.
  * **Target -** Here, select between Screens, Tags, and Tag Rules. To better understand Tags and Tag Rules, read [this article.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/20879903340947-How-to-Use-Content-Tags-in-The-Playlist)
  * **Screens / Tags / Tag Rule** \- Select which screen, tag, or tag rule will be associated with the QR code. This determines where your content will appear.



Once these are input, you have a few other options:

  * **Temp Takeover** \- Allows the QR code to temporarily take over the selected screen. You can select from several predetermined time frames, or create your own.
  * **Schedule Changes** \- Allows you to schedule when the QR code goes live and appears on screen.
  * **Push** \- Immediately push your QR code to the screen, for an indeterminate amount of time.



You'll also be able to Preview your screen before you push it live. Once you do, you're done!
