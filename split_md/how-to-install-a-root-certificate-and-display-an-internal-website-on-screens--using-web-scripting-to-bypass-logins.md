Many internal websites require logins to work. In this case, the Website app will not be sufficient to access them on the OptiSigns app. In this case, we recommend our Web Scripting app.

Follow our complete [guide to using the Web Scripting app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012522362-How-to-use-the-Web-Scripting-App) to set that up.
