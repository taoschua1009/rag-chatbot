### Additional Information on API Authentication

For most token based authentication, setting up the authentication token with the key store is normally all that's required for an API request. But certain APIs (such as Toast) will require additional calls to get the authentication token for each request, this can be handled through pre-request processing. To see how to handle that, see our [article on Toast APIs](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/31113088917907-How-to-use-Toast-API-data-with-OptiSigns).
