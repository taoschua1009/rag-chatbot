## Send to a Teams Rooms Device

Whichever method you've used, you'll need to send your Source to a Teams Rooms device. To begin, click **Assign to rooms**.



Choose the Source you made in the last step, then hit **Next**.



Now you'll be reviewing your preferences for how to display signage on your Rooms app.



There are several parts to take note of here:

  * **Show Teams Rooms banner** \- Displays Room information over top of your digital signage when selected. Remove if you do not want this overlay.
  * **Display Period** \- These settings allow you to configure how quickly your display changes from Teams Rooms settings to your signage.
  * **Allow screen timeout when device is idle** \- When selected, this will keep your default screen settings for timing it out. Deselect this if you want your signage to continuously display.



Once you've tweaked these settings to your liking, hit **Next**. You'll be taken to the Assign rooms screen.



Here, simply choose the Room you want the signage to display it. Hit **Next**.



These options change when these changes will be applied. Pick one, then hit **Next**.

Now you'll review all these changes. Simply hit **Submit** , and you're done.
