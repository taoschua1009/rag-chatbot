#### Soft Reset

A soft reset can be performed if the system is still accessible and operational. This will erase all the data on the device, and may help improve performance and fix some issues.

On the Home screen, go to **Settings**. Hit **Device Preferences,** then choose **About**. Finally, choose **Factory Reset.**



It will ask if you're sure you'd like to perform this function. If you are, hit **OK**. The soft factory reset will take place.
