### Resize

Selecting the **Resize** option allows you to change the size of the design.



Clicking it will open the **Resize** area on the Side Menu:



Here, you'll have a few options:

  * **Orientation -** Switch between Landscape and Portrait orientation.
  * **New Size -** Let's you change the width and height of the design. The default or custom numbers will swap to adjust to selected orientation.
  * **Maintain Aspect Ratio** \- When checked, any change to width or height will be mirrored by the other value.
  * **Use Percentages -** Changes the width and height values from pixels to percentages. Will grey out the orientation selections.
  * **Resize Canvas Size Only -** When checked, will only alter the size of the canvas, not any of the elements present in the design. If not checked, all elements of the design will be resized to match the canvas.



Once you've made the adjustments you'd like, hit the **Resize** button and your design will be resized.
