## Pro/ProMax Player RMA Process

Please try to go through the above common troubleshooting steps before submitting an RMA request.

Devices will be tested in the RMA process. If they work normally, the customer will be charged a restocking fee.

Our RMA process is as follows:

  * Device is eligible for RMA only if it is still within the 12-month warranty period.
  * Fill out **[this RMA form](https://share.hsforms.com/1cTorC26VQqGd-bF-zyzsTwca5m5)** (with proof of purchase in the last 12 months).
  * RMA request is reviewed within 3 business days.
  * New device ships within 3-5 business days to most places in the U.S.
  * Return the old device within 30 days.
