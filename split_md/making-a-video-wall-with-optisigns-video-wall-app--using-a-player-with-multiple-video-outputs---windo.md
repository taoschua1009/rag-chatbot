### Using a Player with Multiple Video Outputs - Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi

You can use OptiSigns on Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi to make simple video walls.

The solution is simple, you will need a player with multiple video outputs.

For example, Raspberry Pi 4 can output 2 screens, you can buy a PC running Windows, and Linux with multiple HDMI, Display Ports output and easily make up 2-6 screens video wall.

Just download OptiSigns player for Win, Linux, and Raspberry Pi (version 4.2.9 or higher required).

Arrange your screens setup as extended and set the position of the screens.



Run OptiSigns app, and resize the player to fill up across all the screens. This can be done in two ways:

  1. Dragging the app to fill up all screens (least precise method)
  2. Fixing your screen size using the Override Win Size & Position (recommended)
