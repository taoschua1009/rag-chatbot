### Setting Up Security Protocol

You'll need to select the appropriate Wi-Fi security protocol that matches your network configuration. The security protocol determines how your Wi-Fi network is protected and how devices communicate securely. The image below shows the available options:



Here's a brief overview of each option:

  * **NONE** :

    * **Description** : This option indicates that the Wi-Fi network has no security, meaning no password is required to connect.
    * **Usage** : This is uncommon for most networks as it leaves your network vulnerable to unauthorized access. It's generally recommended to avoid using unsecured networks for your digital signage.
  * **WPA2-PSK** :

    * **Description** : WPA2-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 - Pre-Shared Key) is the most widely used security protocol for Wi-Fi networks. It provides strong encryption and requires a password to connect.
    * **Usage** : This is the default and most recommended option for both home and business networks due to its balance of security and compatibility.
  * **WPA2-Enterprise** :

    * **Description** : WPA2-Enterprise is a more advanced security protocol often used in corporate environments. It requires a RADIUS server for authentication, offering individual credentials for users rather than a single shared password.
    * **Usage** : If your network is managed by an IT department with a RADIUS server, this is the option you'll need to choose.
  * **WPA3-Personal** :

    * **Description** : WPA3-Personal is the latest Wi-Fi security protocol, offering enhanced protection against brute-force attacks and stronger encryption than WPA2. It also simplifies the process of connecting devices without a display, like IoT devices.
    * **Usage** : Use this option if your network supports WPA3, providing the highest level of security for your digital signage setup.

Note: Make sure to select the security protocol that corresponds with your network settings. If you're unsure which one to choose, consult your network administrator or refer to your router's settings.
