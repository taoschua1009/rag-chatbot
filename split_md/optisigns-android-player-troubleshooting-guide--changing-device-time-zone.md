### Changing Device Time Zone

When **[setting a schedule](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016981853-Create-and-Using-Schedules-with-OptiSigns)** , it's critical that the portal and device share the same time zone. If the time zones are not identical, it can cause your schedule to start at a different time than you'd like. The issue is usually the device's time zone.

To do this, you'll need to change it. Start by pressing the **Home button** on your remote (or hit **Exit App** from the Side Menu), and navigate to the **Settings** menu.



Select **Device Preferences**.



Select **Date & Time**.



Select **Set time zone**.



For some reason, Android devices lead with Midway Island, in the middle of the Pacific (some things in life are best left a mystery). Navigate to your preferred time zone and select it.



Now your device and schedule should sync properly.

**NOTE**  
---  
These steps can be performed remotely using the **Mobile Admin App** or through **MDM Commands**.
