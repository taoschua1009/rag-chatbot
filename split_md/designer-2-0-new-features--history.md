### History

This new feature allows you to track all your most recent changes to your design. 

Careful! Clicking on a previous "event" and starting to make changes to your design will erase any events created after that specific event. 

To access History: 

  * Select the **layered icon** on the right side 
  * OR select **Position** button from the t0ol bar
  * **History** is the right option that will pop up in the side menu
  * **Click** any event to move to that point in your editing
