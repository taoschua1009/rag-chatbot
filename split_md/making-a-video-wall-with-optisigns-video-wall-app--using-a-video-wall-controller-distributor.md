### Using a Video Wall Controller Distributor

You can purchase a video distributor like:

[NIERBO 2x2 HDMI Video Wall Controller](https://amzn.to/3o1caHS) or [iseevy 9 Channel Video Wall Controller](https://amzn.to/3p1GgMF)

Then you can plug in FireStick, or any other player running OptiSigns and have it as an input source for the Video distributor.

Note that if your wall is big, you should use a Video Controller with 4K support, and use FireStick 4K or equivalent devices to output 4K high-resolution content, which will help the quality of your video wall.
