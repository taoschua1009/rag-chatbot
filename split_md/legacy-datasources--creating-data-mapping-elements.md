## Creating Data Mapping Elements

To get started, you'll need to create a design. To do this, go to **Files/Assets → Apps → Designer**.

For this example, we've used one of our [pre-built Templates](https://canvas.optisigns.com/) as the design. For yours, you can explore our 5000+ template library, or create a design from scratch. See our article on [**Getting Started with Designer**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42087942047379-Getting-Started-with-Designer)**** if you need help.

Now, we'll need to add a Data Mapping to an element. Click the Element you want to map to your DataSource, then hit the **Settings** button. Then, click **Make Data Mapping**.



The element will automatically be given an **Element ID.** We also recommend giving it an **Asset Element Name** , which will appear on your generated spreadsheet and can help identify what the value is.



There are also additional options:

  * **Hide when data not available:** When no data is present on the sheet, nothing will display
  * **Empty Data Handling:** When there is no DataSource element, the default behavior is to use the default value. You can adjust this with the following options:
    * **Use Default Value:** Show default content, which is what your element looks like originally.
    * **Use Blank:** Nothing will display.



For more on the **Advanced Options** here, see [**Property Mapping and Display Format**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync#Property).

Now, you'll want to _**repeat this process for every element you wish to be dynamic**_. Make sure you do this before you move on to the next step.
