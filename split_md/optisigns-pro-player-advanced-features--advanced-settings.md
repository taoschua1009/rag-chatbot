### Advanced Settings



On the**Advanced Settings** screen, you can perform various functions such as enabling/disabling Network Proxy, NTP, the On-screen Keyboard, SSH, and configuring a Static IP for either WLAN or Ethernet. Selecting any of these options will enable further options in the window:



  * **Certificate File** **-** Allows you to [install a root certificate](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/35184720136595-How-to-Install-a-Root-Certificate-and-Display-an-Internal-Website-on-Screens) for displaying an internal website. The certificate will need to be present locally on the device in order for it to be installed.
  * **NTP Server****-** Input server information for your Network Time Protocol (NTP). This can be used to ensure the OptiSigns Pro Player has its computer clock time with other time sources in your network.
  * **WiFi SSH IP** \- IP address associated with your SSH. Only appears when SSH is enabled.
  * **Network Proxy****-** Server information for any network proxy. This is a system or router which serves as a middleman between our Pro Player and the internet and can be used to enhance security, privacy, or efficiency.
  * **KeyBoard Layout****-** Choose between various international keyboard layouts. Default is US.
  * **Static IP Information****-** An IP address that remains the same over time. We allow two types of Static IP: WLAN or ETH. These can improve network performance. This screenshot shows WLAN; if Static ETH IP is chosen, these will be ETH IP Address, Default Gateway, Subnet Mask, and DNS Server. 
    * **IP Address -** Set the Static IP address.
    * **Default Gateway** \- Set the Default Gateway for the Static IP address. This is the IP address of your router.
    * **Subnet Mask** \- Set the Subnet Mask for the Static IP. Usually, this number is 255.255.255.0 or some variant of this.
    * **DNS Server** \- Lets you set up your DNS server for the Static IP address.
