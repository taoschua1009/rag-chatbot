## Setting up a Weekly Event Schedule with OptiSync

Setting up a weekly event schedule is much the same as a daily schedule. There are numerous ways you can format your spreadsheet, but one of the easiest is like this:



Here, we've grouped all our events together with their location, date, and time. Depending on your needs, these may need to be input as individual rows, or individual pieces rather than as Repeaters.



Complex weekly schedules like the one above will be easiest to input individually. Selecting the **Row** and dragging it onto your Design will open the following prompt. Hit **Use on its own**.



Organizing your data this way will allow precise placement. We recommend this option when data can't be easily repeated, as in this example where there are different numbers of events on different days.



Your spreadsheet can be updated every week, and a simple refresh will update the design on OptiSigns.
