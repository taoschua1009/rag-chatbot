### Multi Asset Tagging

The most useful way to apply tags to large numbers of assets at once is by multi tagging. This is similar to applying tags to a single asset, except it can be used to apply the tag(s) to numerous assets at once.

Once you've selected the assets you wish to apply the tag(s) to, click the "Edit Tags" button:
