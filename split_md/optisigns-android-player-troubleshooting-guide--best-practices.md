## Best Practices

We recommend certain best practices to keep your OptiSigns Android Player running at peak efficiency:

  * Do not put too much pressure on the power cable, as this can cause the Player to get pulled from its HDMI socket.
  * Keep the player in an indoor, air conditioned environment
  * Run the Android Stick in fullscreen mode, or with a 2-3 zone Split Screen.



By default, an Android Player has an [**Operational Schedule**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/28598173096723-How-To-Create-and-Use-Operational-Schedules-HDMI-CEC-RS-232)built in to ensure it has 8 hours of downtime per day:



If you require 24/7 uptime, more than 3 zones on a split screen, a heavy Website Dashboard (including Tableau or Power BI reports), or plan to use the player in hot or cold environments, consider the [**OptiSigns Pro Player**](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-digital-signage-player) or [**ProMax Player**](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-promax-signage-player).
