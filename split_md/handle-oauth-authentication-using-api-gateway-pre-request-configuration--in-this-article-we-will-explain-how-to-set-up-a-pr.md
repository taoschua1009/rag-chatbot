### In this article, we will explain how to set up a Pre-request to retrieve an OAuth 2.0 access token for connecting to an API using an API Gateway.

OptiSigns API Gateway allows for OAuth authentication via Pre-request. This gives users the capability to consume API that requires OAuth authentication or similar.

To get started, you'll need to set up an API request. Hover over **Account Name → More ****→** Click**DataSources** :



From there, hit **Add Request**.



Create a **GET****Request** and input your API endpoint, then click **Pre-request:**



Within the Pre-request field, input the following code:
    
    
    const body = {  
      "grant_type": "client_credentials",  
      "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",  
      "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>"  
      
    };  
    const params = Object.keys(body || {}).map((key) => {  
            return key + '=' + body[key];  
          }).join('&');  
      
    const {data, headers} = await os.postRequest("<OAUTH_AUTHENTICATION_URL>", params,{headers: {'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}});  
    const token = 'Bearer' + data.access_token;  
    os.context.set("request.headers.authorization", token);

**Notes:**

  * "grant_type": Use "client_credentials" ., because "client_credentials" is the grant type in OAuth for server-side integration without user interaction.
  * <CLIENT_ID> and <CLIENT_SECRET> refers to the user's code for the API being accessed, this will need to be provided by the user.
  * <OAUTH_AUTHENTICATION_URL> refers to the URL the access token is being retrieved from. This URL will need to be provided by the user.



Now configure the **Header** :



With this and the rest of the required fields filled out, you've properly configured your Pre-request. Hitting **Run Test** should return a **200 OK** Response.



If so, hit **Save** to finish your API Request.
