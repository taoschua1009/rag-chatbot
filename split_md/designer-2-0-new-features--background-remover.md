### Background Remover

Automatically detects and removes backgrounds from images. It currently only supports auto-removal and at present it is not possible to custom erase or restore the background. 

To remove the background:

  * Select **Background Remover** from the tool bar
  * Wait for the **loading icon** to finish
  * Click **Save**



Afterwards, it will simply disappear!
