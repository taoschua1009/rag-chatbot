## Screen Tagging

Your screens can be tagged in much the same way as an asset. This has a number of different uses:

  * Organizing numerous screens, by location, type of screen, etc.
  * Grouping sets of screens together for quick pushes of assets or playlists
  * Allowing Emergency Messages/CAP Alerts to appear on certain screens with specific tags
  * Enabling Remote Commands to be able to alter the content displayed on multiple screens at once



You can add as many different tags as you want to a screen. Please note that these screen tags are separate from those tags you may have applied to your assets. For more information on tagging assets, see the **Asset Tagging**section later in this article.

To tag your screens, select the screens, then hit **Edit**.



This will bring up the **Edit Group of Screens** tab. 



In the "Tags" section, you can click the field and you'll be able to select from existing tags, or create a new one.
