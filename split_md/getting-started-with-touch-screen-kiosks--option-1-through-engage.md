### Option 1: Through Engage

This option will be chosen if you click **"Assign"** after setting up your Kiosk design in Kiosk Lite or Content Library Kiosk.





Once you've created the parameters for your kiosk, you can assign it directly to one of your screens. There are two options:

  * **Target -** Select between Screens and Tags. Selecting one or the other will change the next option to either Screens or Tags, depending on which you select here.
  * **Screens / Tags** \- Select which screen or tag where you want your content to appear.



Once you've made your selections, click **Assign** to proceed. If you prefer to wait, choosing **Assign Later** allows you to assign your content at any time through the other options.
