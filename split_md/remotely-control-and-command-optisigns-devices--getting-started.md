### Getting Started

To begin, navigate to your **Screens** tab within OptiSigns.



Here, find the device/screen you want to send remote commands to. Then, hit **Edit**.



This will bring up the **Edit Screen** menu. Here, click **Advanced**.



Under the **Advanced** tab, you'll find a set of green buttons like the ones below. This row of buttons are called the **MDM buttons** and are used for sending Remote Commands.



**NOTE**  
---  
The MDM buttons _**will not appear**_ on non-OptiSigns devices or screens.
