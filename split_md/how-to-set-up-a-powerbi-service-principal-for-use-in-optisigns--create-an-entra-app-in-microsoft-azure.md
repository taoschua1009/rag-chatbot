## Create an Entra App in Microsoft Azure

An Entra app will be responsible for handling identity and access management for your service principal. In order to create one, you'll need to login to Microsoft Azure with a viable Microsoft account.

Once at the Azure portal, search for **"app registrations,"** then select **App Registrations** from the list that appears:



Create a **New Registration**.



On this screen, type a name for the app, then leave the other settings as default. These can be changed or altered at any time.



Once done, hit **Register.**
