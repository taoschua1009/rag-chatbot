## How it Works and When to Use Legacy DataSources

This form of Data Mapping follows these steps:

  1. Mapping data to individual design elements
  2. Generating a Google or Excel spreadsheet of these elements
  3. Altering the spreadsheet so changes are reflected on the design



Different screens can be mapped to the same design so that, depending on where it's shown, the values will be different.

Legacy DataSources are particularly useful for pairing with our [**Scrolling Text**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42436941395475-Widgets-in-Designer#ScrollingText) and [**Scrolling Vertical** widgets](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42436941395475-Widgets-in-Designer#ScrollingVertical), and if you have numerous elements on a single design you wish to be dynamic.
