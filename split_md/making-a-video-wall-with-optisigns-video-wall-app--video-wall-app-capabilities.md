## Video Wall App Capabilities

With the Video Wall app, you can push content to multiple screens at once. There are a few things to keep in mind:

  * The ProMax Player is our _**most recommended**_ __ option if you're looking to use a video wall with digital signage. It allows for 4K video per screen and our full range of options, with up to four screens usable in any orientation.
  * The Pro Player can handle up to 3 screens at a time, at 1080p max resolution.
