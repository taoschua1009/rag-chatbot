## Getting PowerBI onto a Screen

Now we'll need to configure your PowerBI asset in OptiSigns for use with your screens.

In the OptiSigns portal, go to **Files/Assets → Apps → PowerBI**

****

Check **Use Service Principal** and select the service principal you set up in the last step, or whichever service principal you want to use. 

**NOTE:** Using a service principal, the Power BI Dashboard URL link needs to include the actual **workspace (group)** ID instead of me.

****

Finally, input the URL of whatever report you want to share. Name the app whatever you like, then hit **Preview** to view your report.

****

Hit **Save** , then this PowerBI app will exist as an asset. It can be pushed to any of your screens individually, scheduled, or added to a Playlist.
