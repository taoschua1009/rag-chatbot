## Purchasing a Video Wall Add-On

In order to use the Video Wall app, you'll need to buy a Video Wall add-on license. Each license works with a single OptiSigns Pro Player and costs $25/monthy/device.

There are two ways to purchase a license.

The first is to navigate to your **Subscription Plan** tab:



Once there, scroll down to the **Video Wall Add-on** section and choose **Add Screen:**



You'll be prompted to add this add-on to your subscription.

The second way is to pair your subscription directly with your screen. To do this, you'll need to hook up your OptiSigns Pro Player to at least two screens.

Now, set up your screen through the **Edit Screen** option:





Navigate to **Advanced â†’ More** , then find the **Video Wall** option and hit **Activate** :



You'll be prompted to add this add-on to your subscription.

**NOTE:** The Video Wall option will only appear if an OptiSigns Pro Player is attached to the screen.
