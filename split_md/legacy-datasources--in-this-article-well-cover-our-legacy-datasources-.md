### In this article, we'll cover our Legacy DataSources - key-value pair formatting with Google Sheets or Microsoft 365 Excel

  * How it Works and When to Use Legacy DataSources
  * Creating Data Mapping Elements
  * Generating a Google Sheet or Excel Document
  * Modifying the Data



Using Designer, it's possible to assign a key value to an element, then map it to a Google Sheet or Microsoft Excel document. This will create a new spreadsheet directly mapped to the individual design. The values on this new spreadsheet can be modified to change what the design displays.



Please note that this is an older form of Data Mapping in OptiSigns. Now, with our new OptiSync feature, exsiting Google Sheets or MS Excell sheets can be directly integrated into a design with a simple drag-and-drop. It is also possible to directly connect APIs, JSON, XML, or custom tables. See our article on [**Dynamic Data Mapping using OptiSync**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync) for more information.
