### Optional: Connecting to a Non-Broadcast SSID

If your Wi-Fi network does not broadcast its SSID (network name), you will need to manually enter the network information to connect your OptiSigns Pro Player. When you reach the Wi-Fi setup screen, follow these additional steps:

  1. **Access the Wi-Fi SSID Dropdown** : Click on the dropdown menu labeled "WIFI SSID" to see the list of available networks. As shown in the image below, there is an option at the top labeled "Hidden Wifi...". Select this option if your network is not visible in the list.

  2. **Enter Your Hidden SSID** : After selecting "Hidden Wifi...", you will be prompted to manually enter the name (SSID) of your Wi-Fi network. Ensure that the SSID is typed correctly, as this is case-sensitive.
