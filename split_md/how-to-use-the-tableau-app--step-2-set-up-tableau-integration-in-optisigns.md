## Step 2: Set Up Tableau Integration in OptiSigns

Before starting this step, you should have:

  1. Your **Secret ID, Secret Value, and Client ID** from your Connected App in Tableau on hand
  2. Your Connected App set to Enable



When you're ready to go, navigate to the **Integrations** tab within OptiSigns:



Under the Tableau section of the Integrations page, select **Add Connection**.



The **Add** window will pop up:

  
You'll need to fill in 5 values:

  * **Name -** The name of the integration. Put whatever you want to help identify it.
  * **Email -** The email associated with your Tableau account. This **_has to match_**.
  * **Client ID -** The Client ID from the last step.
  * **Secret ID -** The Secret ID from the last step.
  * **Secret Value -** The Secret Value from the last step.



Last, make sure the **Active** box is checked. When unchecked, this saves the integration but does not activate it.

Once these values are filled in, hit **Add**. We are now ready to create a Tableau Asset.
