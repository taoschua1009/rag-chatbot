### Verify the Installation

Close the MMC.

Open a web browser and try accessing the local host domain. If the certificate is installed correctly, you should no longer see the security warning. However, because it's a self-signed root certificate, you might still see a warning indicating that the website's identity cannot be verified.

If you encounter any issues, double-check the file paths, file names, and the output of the Certificate Import Wizard for any error messages.
