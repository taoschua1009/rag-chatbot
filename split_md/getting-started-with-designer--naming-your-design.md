### Naming Your Design

By default, each new design will be titled "Your new untitled design," as shown below.



We recommend changing this name as soon as possible, as, while it is possible to save a design with the default name, it will be hard to identify in your Assets folder.



Once the design has been given a name, it will appear there throughout the design process.
