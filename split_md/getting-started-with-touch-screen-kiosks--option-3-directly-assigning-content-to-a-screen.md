### Option 3: Directly Assigning Content to a Screen

This option will be necessary should you choose **"Save"** or **"Assign Later"** after setting up the kiosk design, and can be done with any type of kiosk design.



If you want to push your kiosk design to a screen, you'll need to find it under the **Engage** tab. Hover over it and you should see three dots. Click on this, and you'll see the **"Push to Screens"** option.



Once there, you'll see these options:



  * **Asset** \- The name of your asset.
  * **Target -** Here, select between Screens, Tags, and Tag Rules. To better understand Tags and Tag Rules, read [this article.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/20879903340947-How-to-Use-Content-Tags-in-The-Playlist)
  * **Screens / Tags / Tag Rule** \- Select which screen, tag, or tag rule will be associated with the Kiosk. This determines where your content will appear.



Once these are input, you have a few other options:

  * **Temp Takeover** \- Allows the Kiosk interface to temporarily take over the selected screen. You can select from several predetermined time frames, or create your own.
  * **Schedule Changes** \- Allows you to schedule when the kiosk interface goes live and appears onscreen.
  * **Push** \- Immediately push your kiosk interface to the screen, for an indeterminate amount of time.



You'll also be able to Preview your screen before you push it live.
