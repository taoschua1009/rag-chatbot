#### Hard Reset

When certain Android system files are corrupted, the device will not be able to boot into the Android system. In this case, you will need to perform a hard reset.

To perform one, you'll need a small tool. Think paperclip, needle, or SIM card pin. Then, ensure the device is completely powered off and the USB power cable is unplugged from the device.

Next, use your small tool to press into the small hole on the side of the device. Hold it, then plug in the power cable while the tool is still pressing the button in the small hole.



The system will then boot into recovery mode. You can use the button to navigate between selections and will need to press and hold for 1-2 secs to confirm selection. Choose **wipe data/factory reset** , and the factory reset will start.



Then choose **Factory data reset:**

Once the process is complete, you'll see a **Data Wipe Complete** message at the bottom of the screen. From there, select **Reboot System Now** to finish.



Your Android Stick will be fully factory reset.
