## Android Tablets and Devices

When using lock down mode on an Android tablet:

  * **Locks Side Menu:** This prevents users from accessing the OptiSigns side menu, thereby blocking the ability to unpair the device, change its orientation, and alter other specific device settings.
  * **Enhance Security and Usability:** It is recommended to enable the "Keep Awake" feature, which ensures the screen remains on even if users attempt to turn it off.
