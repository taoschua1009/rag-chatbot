### Creating a Basic Video Wall

To create a basic video wall, select the number of screens and their orientation. Once you've done so, you'll see the following:



Notice that each screen is known as a **Zone** , mapped to the HDMI ports on your OptiSigns Pro Player. Make sure your screens are arranged in the order displayed here, as it cannot be changed.

There are a few options to note:

**Name** \- The name of your Video Wall App.

**Zone Name** \- The name of the designated zone. Depending on which option you picked, there will be two or three zones. These default to the name of the HDMI port on the OptiSigns Pro Player.

**Type** \- The Type of content to display. You'll choose from **Asset** , **Playlist** , or **Schedule** , then choose the piece of content you want to display.

Clicking the **Gear** icon will lead you to this screen:



**Audio Zone** \- Lets you choose which screen the audio will come from. This can be **All** , or any one of the **HDMI ports** you've assigned a screen to.

**Primary Zone** \- Setting one of your screens as a Primary Zone will provide a better experience or smoother content transition when you need to coordinate contents in different zones and put use the video wall app in a playlist.

  * For example, if the primary zone is utilizing Playlist A, Playlist B and its video wall asset will respect the duration of Playlist A's asset. It will only transition to the next item when the asset in the Primary Zone's playlist is complete, rather than follow the duration setting of the video wall asset placed in Playlist B. This is a great way to avoid videos being cut off early.



For more information on these zones, see our guide on [Advanced Playlist Item Playback Control and Campaign Management.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/22474034993043-Advanced-Playlist-Item-Playback-Control-Campaign-Management)

Should you choose content and assign it to your screens in this way, your video wall will function almost like a split screen, with each screen displaying different content or repeating images:
