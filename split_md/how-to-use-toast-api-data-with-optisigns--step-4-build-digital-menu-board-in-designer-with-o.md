## Step 4: Build Digital Menu Board in Designer with OptiSync 

Now that your API request data source is ready for use, you can build your DMB using Designer with OptiSync. OptiSync allows you to map the API data to an element in the designer, either text or images. Using Repeaters, this data can be used to build out multiple item menus, and you're also able to define how you'd like to handle sold-out items, specials, and more.
