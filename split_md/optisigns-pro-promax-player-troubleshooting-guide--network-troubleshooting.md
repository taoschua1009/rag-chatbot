### Network Troubleshooting

This is, by far, the most common issue people encounter. Devices experiencing network issues typically appear "Offline" in the OptiSigns portal, even when they are powered on and have content assigned to them.



The first stop should be the **Troubleshooting Page**. The upper left box details network status. If all the text is green, this means there are no network issues. Any red text will require further troubleshooting.

To identify and resolve network issues:

  * Create a mobile hotspot, then have your Pro or ProMax player connect with it. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
  * Try a different network. You may need to move the device to get connected. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
  * If you have firewalls, make sure OptiSigns is whitelisted. Refer to our **[Whitelist Article](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047275934)** for the required URLs and ports.
  * Plug in an Ethernet cable to see if it can still connect.
  * After trying to connect with these methods, **Factory Reset** the device, then perform initial setup again.
  * If the device still cannot connect to any network, **[contact our support team](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/35626165056787-How-to-Contact-OptiSigns-Support)**. After a bit of troubleshooting, you may be asked to submit an **RMA request.**
