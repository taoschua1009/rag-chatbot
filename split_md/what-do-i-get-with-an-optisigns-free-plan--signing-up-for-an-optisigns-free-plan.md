## Signing Up for an OptiSigns Free Plan

There are several ways to sign up for an OptiSigns Free Plan:

  * Signing up for an OptiSigns Free Trial, then letting that trial lapse without signing up for a Standard, Pro Plus, Engage, or Enterprise plan
  * Downgrading from a paid plan to a free plan



To see the status of your current plan, head to your **Subscription Plan** by hovering over the Account Name in the upper right corner of your web browser.



There, you'll see the number of screens you have access to, and the type of plan you're using. To change it, hit **Update Subscription**.



You'll be able to change the number of screens and the type of plan you're using.





Select the **Free** option and you'll be all set.
