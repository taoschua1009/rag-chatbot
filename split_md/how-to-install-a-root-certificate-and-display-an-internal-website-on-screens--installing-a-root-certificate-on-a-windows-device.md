## Installing a Root Certificate on a Windows Device

Broadly, there are four major steps to installing a root certificate locally on a Windows device:

  1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
  2. Add the Certificates Snap-In
  3. Import the Certificate
  4. Verify the Installation



These same steps can be performed quickly using the Windows Terminal, if you're so inclined.

Be cautious when installing root certificates, especially self-signed ones. Only install certificates from sources you trust completely.

**NOTE**  
---  
You need administrator privileges to install certificates in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.
