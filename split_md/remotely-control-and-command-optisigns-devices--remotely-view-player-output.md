### Remotely View Player Output

Using the Remote Control feature, it's possible to view what's actually playing on your device, and make changes via the device menu with a mouse.

This is different from the Preview feature, which shows an approximation of what an Asset or Playlist will look like on your screen. The Remote Control feature allows you to actually remote into the device and see what's playing, and interact with the device software directly.

To do this, hit **More** from within the **Advanced** section of the **Edit Screen** menu:



Then, next to **Remote Control** , hit **Activate**.



A pop up will appear asking if you're sure you want to activate Remote Control. Hit **Activate**.



Another box will appear informing you that it may take several seconds to fully remote into the device. Close this box, then scroll up to the main Remote Command area. Another option will have appeared: hit **Remote** to access the device.



This will bring up a new browser window for you to view and control the device.
