To identify and resolve network issues:

  * Create a mobile hotspot, then have your Android Player connect with it. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
  * Try a different network. You may need to move the device to get connected. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
  * Plug in an Ethernet cable to see if it can still connect.



To see what network you're connected to, go to the Side Menu and hit **Exit**. This will close the OptiSigns app.



Next, open the menu on the side using the remote. If connected to a network, it should appear here. If not, you'll need to set that back up.
