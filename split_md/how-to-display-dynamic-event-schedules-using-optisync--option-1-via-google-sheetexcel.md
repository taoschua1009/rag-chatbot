### Option 1: Via Google Sheet/Excel

The simplest way to create a daily schedule is by organizing your event data similarly to the screenshot below:



The **data is mapped from Row 2 onwards** , and is **grouped by Row.** This means when the DataSource is added to OptiSigns, it will be clustered like this:



Since this is a daily schedule, we're only worried about the time of the event, and we've also included a description. However, you can include all kinds of information should you feel it necessary.

Now, you'll need to add your DataSource to OptiSigns.

**Please follow these guides to upload different kinds of DataSources:**

Now that your DataSource is added, we can get started in Designer.

Daily events are best mapped as a **Repeater**. These allow you to set up a single design and have all your data appear within it

To set up a repeater, drag your first **Row** onto your design. You'll receive the below prompt. Select **Use in a Repeater**.



You'll be able to format your data however you wish.
