## How to Build Digital Menu Boards in Designer with OptiSync

In order to create a DMB with data from your POS system, the API Request will need to be registered as a DataSource. This allows data elements to be added to [OptiSigns' Designer app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404151402899-How-to-use-OptiSigns-Template-Designer-app-to-make-your-Digital-Signs-in-minutes), where it can be formatted and incorporated into any visual design you'd like to display.

The Designer app and templates can be used to do the formatting, and mapping the element to the data from the API data source. Any text box or image element can be mapped in Designer. When you map an image element, the URL of the image will be replaced at run time.
