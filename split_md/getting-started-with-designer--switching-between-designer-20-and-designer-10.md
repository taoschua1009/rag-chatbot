## Switching Between Designer 2.0 and Designer 1.0

To go back to the old 1.0 version of Designer, simply click the **Use Designer 1.0** button in the upper right corner of the screen.



**NOTE**  
---  
Designer 1.0 is planned to be obsoleted by end-of-year 2025, and all designs created going forward will use Designer 2.0.
