## For Multiple OptiSigns Players

It's possible to send basic remote commands to individual players, segments of OptiSigns players (defined via [tagging](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/38062664690195-Tagging-in-OptiSigns)), or all your OptiSigns players simultaneously. These commands allow for mass provisioning, updating, and troubleshooting.

The ability to do this needs to be activated. Simply contact us at [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com) to be given the ability to send remote commands.
