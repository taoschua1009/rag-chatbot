### Layers

Similarly, Objects has been renamed to Layers and moved to the left-hand side menu. This allows you to edit the positioning or layering of any of the elements of your design.

To access Layers:

  * Select the **layered icon** on the right side
  * OR select **Position**
  * Select **Layers**



Then you can select any of the elements and move them around to change their position or "layering."
