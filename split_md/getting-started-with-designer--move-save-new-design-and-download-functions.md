### Move, Save, New Design, and Download Functions

The **Move** , **Save** , **New Design** , and **Download** functions are to the right of the name.



These work the same way as in most other applications:

**Move -** Lets you move the Design asset to different folders. When hitting this button, a popup will appear allowing you to **Select Folder**.



You can also create a New Folder here if needed.

**Save -** Saves your Design asset. This will overwrite any earlier versions of the asset, unless you give it another name.

**NOTE**  
---  
Hitting **Save** with a blank design triggers a warning letting you know you are saving a blank design. The design will not save.  
  


Any time a change is made to your design without saving, a notification will appear in the Top Menu alerting you that you have unsaved changes:



**New Design -** Exits the current design and creates a new one. The **New Design** panel will appear on the left sidebar:



Here, you can determine the New Design's orientation and size.

**Download -** Downloads the current design to your local device. You'll be able to rename the file, and choose between **PNG** and **JPG** filetypes.
