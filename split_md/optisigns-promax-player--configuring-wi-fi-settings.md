### Configuring Wi-Fi Settings

Upon first boot (_make sure there is no LAN connected_), the OptiSigns ProMax Player will prompt you to configure your Wi-Fi settings using Mobile Admin app or manually, as shown in the image below:



To perform manual Wi-Fi setup connect keyboard and muse(optional) and hit the Enter key to fill out Wi-Fi details, as shown on the screenshot below, first you choose Wi-Fi SSID and also on the bottom you can see device MAC and Hostname:



After choosing SSID, you can choose security type and enter credentials. (If you choose WPA-Enterprise with TLS make sure your certificate is in .pem format)



Here's what each field means and what you need to do:

  * **WIFI SSID** : Select the name of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to from the dropdown list.
  * **WIFI Password** : Enter the password for the selected Wi-Fi network. You can click on the eye icon to show or hide the password as you type.
  * **WIFI Security** : This dropdown lets you choose the type of security protocol your Wi-Fi network uses. By default, this is set to WPA2-PSK, which is the most common and secure option.



Once you have entered all the required information, click on the "**CONNECT** " button to link your OptiSigns Pro Player to the Wi-Fi network.
