### Image Masking

Our new tool allows you to apply shapes or elements as masks to images. 

  * Click on the **Mask** icon from the tool bar
  * Select any **shape** or search for more shapes on the left side menu





The mask and the image attach automatically when you select it. 

To edit the placement on the picture, **Edit Mask** detaches the overlaid shape. 

**Apply Mask** reapplies it and groups it back together. 

To delete the shape altogether, select **Remove Mask**.
