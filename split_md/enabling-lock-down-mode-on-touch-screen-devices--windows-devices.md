## Windows Devices

You will need to disable edge swipe to prevent users from swiping out of the application. Instructions on how to do this may differ based on your device. (Through your device's Local Group Policy Editor, Registry Editor, etc.).

Once done, a Windows device in lockdown mode will be:

  * **Completely Locked Down:** Users can only interact with the content being displayed on the screen.
  * **Side Menu Inaccessible:** Users cannot open the OptiSigns side menu, exit the app, unpair the screen, or mess with the device.
