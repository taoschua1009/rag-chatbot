### Undo/Redo



The **Undo** option does what it says on the tin - it undoes the last action. If this button is pushed in error, the **Redo** button will fix it.

**NOTE**  
---  
The Undo command can also be performed using **CTRL+Z** on a Windows machine or **Cmd+Z** on a Mac. Redo can be performed using **CTRL+Y** on Windows or **Cmd+SHIFT+Z** on Mac.
