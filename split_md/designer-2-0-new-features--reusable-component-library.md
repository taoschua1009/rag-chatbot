### Reusable Component Library

This feature allows you to save any design element or grouped elements to a component library. Save any element you like and create a library of branded or themed elements, or simply one that you wanted to save for later!

To add the component: 

  * Click on **the element** you would like to save
  * Select **More**
  * Select **Add Component**



To access the components: 

  * Click on **Your Temp** from the left side bar
  * Click on **Components**



You will now be able to add to any design!

This works with elements or designs you create, whole templates from our library, or single elements from a template.
