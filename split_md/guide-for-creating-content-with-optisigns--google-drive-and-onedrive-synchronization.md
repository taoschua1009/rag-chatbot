### Google Drive and OneDrive Synchronization

With OptiSigns, you can quickly put images and videos from your Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive on your screens using our integrated apps. These apps will create a playlist for files in your dedicated drives, and any changes or updates will automatically be synced. This allows you to update and share content within your team without needing to login to OptiSigns portal.
