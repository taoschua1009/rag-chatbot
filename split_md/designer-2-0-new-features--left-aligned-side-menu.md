### Left-Aligned Side Menu

The biggest change for users will be the look and placement of functions in Designer 2.0. The new version streamlines the design, left-aligning a lot of the previous buttons and functions. 

Most functions are now relocated to the left-hand side.



The left side menu will also replace the pop-up window that was utilized for certain functions.

The functions now in the left side menu include: 

  * Position
  * Layers, formerly called "Objects" 
  * Data Sources
  * Animation
  * Widget format options
  * Settings
  * Text
  * And more



For example, Animations controls will now appear in the left side menu.
