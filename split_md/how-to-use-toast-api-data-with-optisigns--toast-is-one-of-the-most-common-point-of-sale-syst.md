### Toast is one of the most common Point-of-Sale systems in North America. In this article, we'll explain how to set up API integration between your Toast system and OptiSigns.

  * Step 1: Preparation
  * Step 2: Authentication to Toast API
  * Step 3: Call the API to Get the Required Data from Toast
  * Step 4: Build the DMB Designer with OptiSync



Toast provides an API for users to integrate POS data with other systems. With OptiSync, building auto-updating digital menu boards from your Toast API's data is simple.

Toast API requires a dynamically generated authentication token to be supplied with every API call, unlike many other POS systems that use a static API key. This adds some complexity to the integration that other POS systems don't have. However, using OptiSigns' API request and OptiSync, these added complexities are no trouble at all.

In this article, we'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to integrate your Toast API using OptiSigns API request, and how to create a DMB using OptiSync. Below are the high level steps we will follow:

1\. Get required information from Toast portal

2\. Get the Authentication Token from Toast (Inside Pre-Request step)

3\. Call the API to get the required data from Toast

4\. Use Toast API data to build DMB in designer with OptiSync
