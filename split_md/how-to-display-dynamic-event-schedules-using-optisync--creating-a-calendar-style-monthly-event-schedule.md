### Creating a Calendar-Style Monthly Event Schedule

Calendar-style monthly event schedules, as the name suggests, present your event data in a calendar format. This is the best option if you want to see a great many events at a glance.

Should you choose the calendar-style format, space is a primary concern. You'll have to pick and choose which pieces of data you want to display - long descriptions of an event, for example, would not be able to fit on a normal sized calendar. Fortunately, you do not have to discard any of your data, nor edit your spreadsheet. All you have to do is choose what individual pieces of data you want to place on your calendar.

For this example, we'll only use the name of the Lunch and the Day of the Month on the menu. You could easily add a time repeater, as well.

Your data can be placed on a calendar design anywhere you like. Below, we've set up the entire calendar as a repeater and added the days of the week above.
