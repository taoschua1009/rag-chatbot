### Tagging for Remote Commands

Screen tags can also be used by OptiSigns Remote Commands to send direct commands to multiple screens at a time. This can be anything from forcing an update to changing the content displaying on screen.

**NOTE**  
---  
Remote Commands can only be used by **Pro Plus** subscribers or above.
