## Setting Up a Split Screen Event Schedule

Creating a split-screen for your event schedule is a fantastic way to maximize your screens, allowing both pertinent information and promotional material to be disseminated simultaneously. A split screen event schedule can make use of either Landscape or Portrait formatted designs of any type. You can use any of the above types of event schedules in a split screen.

For this example, we're going to put together a number of techniques we've learned above, using this data example:



For this event schedule, we want to make use of all our data. So, we'll need a repeater which shows the Event Name, Event Time, End Time (or Duration), Event Location, and Event Description, as well as organizing them by day of the week.

There are a few ways to do this. You can simply attach the Day of the Week to each Repeater value, giving us something like this:



Or, you can create individual repeaters for each day of the week, allowing them to cycle.

Then, when you're ready, you can attach it to your split screen app, creating a beautiful event schedule without getting in the way of anything else you'd like to display.
