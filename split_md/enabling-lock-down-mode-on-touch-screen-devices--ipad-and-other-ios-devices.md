## iPad and Other iOS Devices

For iPad or other iOS devices, you can use either Guided Access or Apple Configurator to lock a singular app on your device. You can learn more about how to set up Guided Access [here](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/25273043501587). This method will make the device:

  * Unable to exit the app or access the control center to make changes to the device itself
  * If you press "Exit App" in guided access and lock down, it will close then reopen.



If you have many devices and would like to easier manage them, you can use the Apple Configurator. To learn more about this [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-mac/start-single-app-mode-cadbf9c172/mac).
