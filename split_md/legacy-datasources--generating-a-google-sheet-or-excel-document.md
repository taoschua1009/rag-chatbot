## Generating a Google Sheet or Excel Document

Once you've mapped all the elements you want to be dynamic, it's time to generate your spreadsheet. To do this, click the **DataSource** button on the Side Menu, then click **Add DataSource** :



Scroll down in the popup to the **Adv. DataSources** section and choose either **Google Sheets (legacy)** or **MS Excel 365 (legacy)** depending on which you prefer.



Clicking one of these will bring up the option to sign in with your account of choice. 



**NOTE**  
---  
This requires a paid account for Microsoft 365, as the free account does not support this feature. Without a paid MS 365 account, we recommend a Google Sheet.  
  
Give the Sheet a **Name** , then sign in to your preferred account. You will need to provide certain permissions for this to work. See our [Privacy Policy](https://www.optisigns.com/privacy-policy) for additional information.

Next, you'll be asked to provide the Folder for where you want your sheet to be saved. Select one, then continue. Your DataSource will be created:



**IMPORTANT**  
---  
Data must be within a table if using Excel Sheets.   
  
At this point, you can access your spreadsheet to see the elements you've mapped by hitting the **Open** button.



The elements you've mapped will appear in the sheet.
