### Google Font Weights Support

We now have full font weight options for our Google Fonts (for example, Thin, Light, Regular, Bold). 

Note: This is only available for Google Fonts.



To change the font weight: 

  * **Select** the text you would like to change or add a text box 
  * **Click** the font name on the tool bar
  * **Choose** a font from the left side menu



If the font you choose is a Google font, the options will drop down underneath the font name.
