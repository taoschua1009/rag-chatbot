## How to Integrate POS Systems Through API Requests

Most POS systems have an API library which OptiSigns can use to get the relevant data from the system programmatically. This API can return menu items, item price, availability, and more.

With OptiSync, we can link APIs to the OptiSigns portal and push the data to screens as a Digital Menu Board (DMB) or any other type of screen you'd like without the need of human intervention.



This article will focus on these POS specific wrinkles, and the process of mapping POS data to assets and pushing them to screens.
