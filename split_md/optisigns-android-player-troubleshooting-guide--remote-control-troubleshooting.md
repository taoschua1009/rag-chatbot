### Remote Control Troubleshooting

The OptiSigns Android Player ships with a Remote Control. Which remote control you have depends on the version of your player, but they largely function the same with a few slight differences.

**Gen 2 Remote:**



**NOTE**

To pair or re-pair this remote, hold the **Return** and **OK** buttons.  
  
OptiSigns Players also support the [**Mobile Admin App**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/30003143806099-How-to-Use-the-OptiSigns-Mobile-Admin-App) as a Remote Control. This is our **_top recommendation,_** as not only does it function as a true remote control (allowing you to control your players from anywhere), but it has numerous other features as well.

If your remote control is having issues:

  * Ensure batteries have been installed inside your remote control, and that they are not dead
  * Re-pair your remote control with the player
  * Try a plug-in USB keyboard or mouse
  * Use the Mobile Admin app to set up Wi-Fi, or as a remote control itself
